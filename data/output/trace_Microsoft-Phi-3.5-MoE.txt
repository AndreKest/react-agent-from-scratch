  "summary": "In mathematics, exponentiation is an operation involving two numbers: the base and the exponent or power. Exponentiation is written as bn, where b is the base and n is the power; often said as \"b to the power n\". When n is a positive integer, exponentiation corresponds to repeated multiplication of the base: that is, bn is the product of multiplying n bases:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                b\n                ×\n                b\n                ×\n                ⋯\n                ×\n                b\n                ×\n                b\n              \n              ⏟\n            \n          \n          \n            n\n            \n               times\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{n}=\\underbrace {b\\times b\\times \\dots \\times b\\times b} _{n{\\text{ times}}}.}\n  \nIn particular, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        =\n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{1}=b}\n  \n. \nThe exponent is usually shown as a superscript to the right of the base as bn or in computer code as b^n, and may also be called \"b raised to the nth power\", \"b to the power of n\", \"the nth power of b\", or most briefly \"b to the n\".\nThe above definition of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{n}}\n  \n immediately implies several properties, in particular the multiplication rule:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  b\n                  \n                    n\n                  \n                \n                ×\n                \n                  b\n                  \n                    m\n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        b\n                        ×\n                        ⋯\n                        ×\n                        b\n                      \n                      ⏟\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    n\n                    \n                       times\n                    \n                  \n                \n                ×\n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        b\n                        ×\n                        ⋯\n                        ×\n                        b\n                      \n                      ⏟\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    m\n                    \n                       times\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        b\n                        ×\n                        ⋯\n                        ×\n                        b\n                      \n                      ⏟\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    n\n                    +\n                    m\n                    \n                       times\n                    \n                  \n                \n                 \n                =\n                 \n                \n                  b\n                  \n                    n\n                    +\n                    m\n                  \n                \n                .\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}b^{n}\\times b^{m}&=\\underbrace {b\\times \\dots \\times b} _{n{\\text{ times}}}\\times \\underbrace {b\\times \\dots \\times b} _{m{\\text{ times}}}\\\\[1ex]&=\\underbrace {b\\times \\dots \\times b} _{n+m{\\text{ times}}}\\ =\\ b^{n+m}.\\end{aligned}}}\n  \n\nThat is, when multiplying a base raised to one power times the same base raised to another power, the powers add.
