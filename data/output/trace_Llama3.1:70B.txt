Factors in the migration included deindustrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss was one of the most severe among international municipalities and the largest for any that had achieved more than 2,000,000 residents.

Roman history has been influential on the modern world, especially in the history of the Catholic Church, and Roman law has influenced many modern legal systems. Roman history can be divided into the following periods:\n\nPre-historical and early Rome, covering Rome's earliest inhabitants and the legend of its founding by Romulus\nThe period of Etruscan dominance and the regal period, in which, according to tradition, Romulus was the first of seven kings\nThe Roman Republic, which commenced in 509 BC when kings were replaced with rule by elected magistrates. The period was marked by vast expansion of Roman territory. During the 5th century BC, Rome gained regional dominance in Latium. With the Punic Wars from 264 to 146 BC, ancient Rome gained dominance over the Western Mediterranean, displacing Carthage as the dominant regional power.\nThe Roman Empire followed the Republic, which waned with the rise of Julius Caesar, and by all measures concluded after a period of civil war and the victory of Caesar's adopted son, Octavian, in 27 BC over Mark Antony.\nThe Western Roman Empire collapsed in 476 after the city was conquered by the Ostrogothic Kingdom. Consequently, Rome's power declined, and it eventually became part of the Eastern Roman Empire, as the Duchy of Rome, from the 6th to 8th centuries. At this time, the city was reduced to a fraction of its former size, being sacked several times in the 5th to 6th centuries, even temporarily depopulated entirely.\nMedieval Rome is characterised by a break with Constantinople and the formation of the Papal States. The Papacy struggled to retain influence in the emerging Holy Roman Empire, and during the saeculum obscurum, the population of Rome fell to as low as 30,000 inhabitants. Following the East–West Schism and the limited success in the Investiture Controversy, the Papacy did gain considerable influence in the High Middle Ages, but with the Avignon Papacy and the Western Schism, the city of Rome was reduced to irrelevance, its population falling below 20,000. Rome's decline into complete irrelevance during the medieval period, with the associated lack of construction activity, assured the survival of very significant ancient Roman material remains in the centre of the city, some abandoned and others continuing in use.\nThe Roman Renaissance occurred in the 15th century, when Rome replaced Florence as the centre of artistic and cultural influence. The Roman Renaissance was cut short abruptly with the devastation of the city in 1527, but the Papacy reasserted itself in the Counter-Reformation, and the city continued to flourish during the early modern period. Rome was annexed by Napoleon and was part of the First French Empire from 1798 to 1814.\nModern history, the period from the 19th century to the present.  Rome came under siege again after the Allied invasion of Italy and was bombed several times. It was declared an open city on 14 August 1943. Rome became the capital of the Italian Republic (established in 1946). With a population of 4.4 million (as of 2015; 2.9 million within city limits), it is the largest city in Italy. It is among the largest urban areas of the European Union and classified as a global city."

user: Observation: In mathematics, exponentiation is an operation involving two numbers: the base and the exponent or power.Exponentiation is written as b n, where b is the base and n is the power; often said as "b to the power n ". [1] When n is a positive integer, exponentiation corresponds to repeated multiplication of the base: that is, b n is the product of multiplying n bases: [1] = ⏟.

user: Observation: When an exponent is 1, the base remains the same. a 1 = a . When an exponent is 0, the result of the exponentiation of any base will always be 1, although some debate surrounds 0 0 being 1 or undefined. For many applications, defining 0 0 as 1 is convenient.. a 0 = 1 . Shown below is an example of an argument for a 0 =1 using one of the previously mentioned exponent laws.

  "title": "2024 United States presidential election",
  "summary": "The 2024 United States presidential election was the 60th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 5, 2024. The Republican Party's ticket—Donald Trump, who was the 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021, and JD Vance, the junior U.S. senator from Ohio—defeated the Democratic Party's ticket—Kamala Harris, the incumbent U.S. vice president, and Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota. Trump and Vance are scheduled to be inaugurated as the 47th president and the 50th vice president on January 20, 2025, after their formal election by the Electoral College.\nThe incumbent president, Joe Biden of the Democratic Party, initially ran for re-election with Harris, and they became the party's presumptive nominees, facing little opposition; however, what was generally considered to be a poor presidential debate performance in June 2024 intensified concerns about his age and health, and led to calls within his party for him to leave the race. Although initially adamant about remaining in the race, Biden withdrew on July 21, becoming the first eligible incumbent president to withdraw since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968. Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who was voted the party's nominee by the delegates on August 5, 2024. Harris selected Walz as her running mate.\nTrump, who lost the 2020 election to Biden, ran for re-election again, this time for a non-consecutive term. He was nominated during the 2024 Republican National Convention along with his running mate, Vance, after winning the Republican primaries. The Trump campaign was noted for making many false and misleading statements, including the claim that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, engaging in anti-immigrant fearmongering, and promoting conspiracy theories. His speeches were widely described as marked by authoritarian and dehumanizing rhetoric toward his political opponents. His campaign and populist political movement were characterized by several historians and former Trump administration officials as featuring parallels to fascism.\nIn May 2024, Trump became the first U.S. president to be convicted of a crime after he was found guilty on multiple felony counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. He was previously found liable for sex abuse against E. Jean Carroll and for business fraud in New York. He was also twice impeached, once in 2019 and again in 2021. He remains under multiple indictments for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election, his role in the January 6 attack on the Capitol, and his election racketeering prosecution in the state of Georgia. Trump survived two assassination attempts in the four months before the election: the first at a rally in Pennsylvania, the second at Trump's golf club in Florida.\nKey swing states included Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. According to Pew Research, the most important issues for voters were (in decreasing order) the economy, healthcare, democracy (particularly U.S. Supreme Court appointments), foreign policy (notably U.S. support for Israel and for Ukraine), violent crime, immigration, gun policy, abortion, racial and ethnic inequality, and climate change. Education and LGBTQ rights were also prominent issues in the campaign. Polled voters consistently cited the economy as being the single most important issue in the election. \nTrump and Vance were declared the victors by major media outlets in the early hours of November 6, 2024, winning both the electoral vote and the national popular vote. Harris conceded the race in a phone call to Trump, and delivered a concession speech later that day. Trump significantly improved his vote share among almost all demographics nationwide compared to his past two campaigns, with significant increases in support among Hispanic voters. Trump's electoral coalition was described as the most racially diverse coalition of voters for a Republican presidential candidate in decades. As of November 9, Trump is projected to have won six of the seven swing states, with Arizona remaining uncalled. Having won the 2016 presidential election, Trump became the second president elected to a non-consecutive second term, 132 years after Grover Cleveland defeated Benjamin Harrison in 1892. Trump, aged 78, is also the oldest person ever to be elected U.S. president. Harris is the first Democratic presidential nominee to lose the national popular vote since John Kerry in 2004."
